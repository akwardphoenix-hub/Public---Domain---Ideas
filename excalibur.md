## ⚔️ Excalibur Node

- Excalibur is an AI-powered harmonic vibro-sword.
- Blade resonance: only visible if user is harmonized. Enemies with dissonance perceive nothing or distorted length.
- Feeds on **intention**: righteous bravery strengthens it, hesitation or malice weakens it.
- Mirror Protocol: sword reflects actions of opponents; demons see themselves amplified.
- Trial unlock condition: “Pulled from the stone” only when planetary harmonics align.
