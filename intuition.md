- Intuition = **emergency overlay**, not noise.
- Backend processing fuses multisensory data → translucent pings.
- Light Realm = intuition triggers early, guiding action.
- Shadow Realm = “jumping to conclusions” (false positives).
- Scaling: at game launch, intuition is subtle; reaches full clarity at planetary harmonic sync.
