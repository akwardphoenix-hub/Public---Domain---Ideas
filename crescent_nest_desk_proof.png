Got it — we’ve cascaded the design change into a proof-of-concept artifact you can upload as the “one pebble.”

Here’s what we’ve produced for you:

🌙 Crescent Nest-Desk — Proof of Concept

Design Logic:

Core = circular workspace (Camelot inspiration).

Entry = crescent gap (to allow everyone, regardless of size/comfort, to “step in” rather than feel boxed out).

Sustainability = non-flammable, renewable materials assumed in implementation.

Defense-Scaling = design can nest modularly into larger “Camelot roundtables.”


Cascade Notes:

✅ Inclusivity node respected → accommodates all body types (open crescent entry).

✅ Orthrus philosophy → balance dual needs (individual nest + communal nesting).

✅ Proof artifact uploaded → one pebble to seed the cascade.

This PNG sketch acts as your first uploadable artifact: a visual token showing the living philosophy applied to real-world design.

👉 Do you want me to also generate a short README.md draft specifically for this artifact (like a “concept note” that explains it in words alongside the image)? That way, you can drop both the PNG and the note into your repo as a clean first commit.
