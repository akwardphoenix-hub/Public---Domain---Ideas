# VIMANA: Harmony Protocol — Final Export Document
**Author / Origin:** Unattributed public domain seed (CC0)  
**Prepared by:** Collective window synthesis (for public domain release)  
**License:** CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)

---

## Executive summary
VIMANA is a living, multi-season, hybrid game / governance / civic engagement layer that combines: memetic mechanics, debate-as-combat mini-games (mindmon), personal masternodes (player-as-RNG/cybersecurity unit), culturally aware seasonal nodes, and a fix-it-first security philosophy. It is designed to be fun, inclusive, multilingual, and to provide measurable civic engagement and transparent incentives for public good.

Core aims:
- **Fix it first:** prioritize safety, resilience and repair before rollout.
- **Every player is a masternode:** user RNG + identity = personal cyber layer.
- **Memetics + governance:** memes are a primary UX & verification input.
- **Accessibility & fairness:** alternative input methods, time adjustments, and rewards for slower / disabled players.
- **Public domain seed:** all concepts released CC0; anyone may adapt.

---

## High-level architecture (conceptual)
- **Client layer**: game clients (web, mobile, VR), voice/brain-text options, baby-soundboard simplified clients.
- **Edge layer**: local device peripherals (microphone, camera — opt-in only), inertial/gyro inputs, optional home-camera integration for pause/limbo features (strict privacy gating).
- **Masternode layer**: each user has identity-backed masternode (wallet + RNG seed + public stats). Masternodes form rings/coalitions for verification.
- **Council & Nodes**: elected/appointed nodes (legendary, polymath, art history, bees, pattern-keepers, archangels, etc.) that provide thematic governance and content moderation via on-chain proposals.
- **Shadow realm**: purposely exploitable sandbox environment used to surface zero-day behaviors and train defenses.
- **Cosmic layer**: optional external integration (federated nodes, diplomatic exports, alien-node placeholders for future contact protocols).
- **Data layer**: audited, signed event logs; privacy preserving; replays for forensics (opt-in).
- **Security fabric**: multi-layered (peripheral opt-ins, signed messages, redundancy, white/grey/black hat buckets).

---

## Season + Gameplay primitives
- **Season seeds**: every season chooses a Master Seed (logic, theme, node) that drives world rules and scoring.
- **Autobattler + Mindmon**: main loop is simultaneous action selection. Mindmon mini-game = debate/choice mechanic where players choose value/philosophy cards (rock/paper/scissors elements like Earth/Fire/Water/Metal/Void + Kong/Wuji).
- **Timing system**: baseline time window (example: 5s per decision) with adjustments for non-typers (speech→text, brain→text, assistive input), and bonus multipliers for increased relative speed (not to penalize baseline fastest).
- **Pause / Limbo**:
  - **Personal Pause**: instantaneous, full game-state save; immediate return without loss.
  - **Agreed Pause**: vote or opponent consent pause for synchronized events.
  - **No-Cost Limbo**: limbo is a safe save state, but prolonged use may have cosmetic-only effects — it does *not* break fair play.
  - Accessibility: longer baseline allowed based on user profile; everyone keeps fastest timing but receiving assistance increases rewarded bonuses.
- **Shadow realm**: places for testing, exploits, training red/blue teams — data harvested to auto-patch in a "fix it first" cycle.

---

## Nodes & Roles (selected)
- **Legendary (masternode)**: sentinel mascot, voice of tradition and riddle-giver. Riddle example (for family / justice themes):  
  *“You don’t fear the dark because you are its fiercest thing. Speak what breaks it.”*
- **Polymath**: system integrator node blending science, craft, engineering, and cryptography. Responsible for harmonics, quartz battery research nodes, and algorithmic fairness.
- **Bees (ecology node)**: economic/currency experiments (bee wallets), environmental incentives, honey = universal micro-resource utility.
- **Pattern Keepers**: cryptographers, Sudoku-style puzzle masters, guardians of secrets and the Cicada/translator efforts.
- **Archangel/Angel nodes**: fairness & audit roles (supervisory, not magic — limited powers with logging/auditing).
- **Shadow / Demi-Loki mode**: cosmetic/achievement category for players experimenting with void-like styles without the privileges.

---

## Ethics, privacy, and accessibility
- **Opt-in data** only. Cameras, mic, or ambient sensors must be explicit and reversible.
- **No parental camera for children** unless 18+. Baby soundboard clients work without cameras.
- **Accessibility**: longer base timers, speech-to-text, brain-to-text integration (when available), and alternative objectives such as exercise mini-tasks.
- **No abuse clauses**: hate speech/targeted threats are banned; memes allowed but gated by contextual toxicity filters and community council votes.
- Replace harmful language: where public text used problematic words, replaced with "oddly inspiring."

---

## Security & “fix it first” mechanics
- **Masternode verification**: ID-backed, rotating attestations, human + cryptographic identity link.
- **Shadow realm bounty**: a controlled exploit zone feeding auto-patch pipelines.
- **3-Strike Bee Law**: theft of critical ecological assets (like bee wallets) triggers escalating penalties — replace/restore ×3 rule; heavy Council review for fringe cases (accident, mitigation).
- **Ghost containment**: define degrees of "ghost in the machine" (0.000000000001 residual errors) and put containment & audit clauses in chain policy.
- **Checksum + integrity**: every major proposal & binary release is checksummed and signed.

---

## Cultural / religious / diplomacy nodes
- Soft-coded nodes for prayer times, festival events, and cultural rituals — each requires community/council approval and local experts’ review. Respect & translation layers are required.
- **Council approval** required for using real leaders’ likeness or official religious texts.
- **Language & translator stack**: universal translator node (memetic + linguistic composite) seeded by curated high-quality datasets (Reddit historic answers, vetted scholarship) — gated & audited.

---

## Energy / harmonics / quartz battery concept (polymath)
- **Harmonic Energy node**: research node (speculative) — integrates sound/harmonic energy with crystal resonators (quartz prototypes), geomantic synchronizers (pyramid anchors), and North-Star timing references.
- **Prototype spec (R&D)**: concept doc only. Do not build with real hardware without electrical & safety professionals.
- **Wuji / Kong / Void**: modeling metaphors for adaptive/regressive void effects and how they modify power & timing loops.

---

## Governance, economy & crypto
- **Player wallets** = masternodes. They store identity + reputation + resources.
- **Seasonal tokens** for civic campaigns, political incentives, and post-term legacy channels for politicians (transparent on-chain donations to civic projects).
- **No infinite-upsides**: economic mechanics designed so win = risk; hedge conditions required to protect ecosystem.

---

## Release protocol, Mercy Clause & Nightmare Safeguards
- **Mercy clause / release protocol**: emergency kill-switch gating, council vouches, and mathematical ledger closure ("let math close the ledger").
- **Nightmare safeguard**: final-state protection — refuses to execute irreversible world-level changes without multisig council accept + human oversight.

---

## Appendix A — Glossary (short)
- **Masternode**: user identity + RNG + wallet.
- **Mindmon**: debate/choice battler.
- **Shadow realm**: test & exploit environment.
- **Limbo**: paused safe game state.
- **Bee law**: ecology/asset protection legal nodes.
- **Wuji / Kong**: regressive & adaptive void subnodes.
- **Polymath**: interdisciplinary integration node.

---

## Summary
This repo contains the living design for "Vimana": a layered game + civic masternode model with the core principles:
- **Fix-it-first**: security & safety are built before cosmetic/gameplay layering.
- **Personal masternodes**: each citizen/player is their own RNG/security node.
- **Harmony & resonance**: time/astral anchors (North Star time, Sun/Moon/pyramids) integrated into UX.
- **Civic-economic tie-in**: transparent incentives for public goods; modular political engagement channels.
- **Open culture**: CC0 — use, remix, steward.
