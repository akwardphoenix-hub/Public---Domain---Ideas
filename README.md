# VIMANA: Harmony Protocol — Final Export Document
**Author / Origin:** Unattributed public domain seed (CC0)  
**Prepared by:** Collective window synthesis (for public domain release)  
**License:** CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)

## Executive summary
VIMANA is a living, multi-season, hybrid game / governance / civic engagement layer that combines: memetic mechanics, debate-as-combat mini-games (mindmon), personal masternodes (player-as-RNG/cybersecurity unit), culturally aware seasonal nodes, and a fix-it-first security philosophy. It is designed to be fun, inclusive, multilingual, and to provide measurable civic engagement and transparent incentives for public good.

Core aims:
- **Fix it first:** prioritize safety, resilience and repair before rollout.
- **Every player is a masternode:** user RNG + identity = personal cyber layer.
- **Memetics + governance:** memes are a primary UX & verification input.
- **Accessibility & fairness:** alternative input methods, time adjustments, and rewards for slower / disabled players.
- **Public domain seed:** all concepts released CC0; anyone may adapt.

## High-level architecture (conceptual)
- **Client layer**: game clients (web, mobile, VR), voice/brain-text options, baby-soundboard simplified clients.
- **Edge layer**: local device peripherals (microphone, camera — opt-in only), inertial/gyro inputs, optional home-camera integration for pause/limbo features (strict privacy gating).
- **Masternode layer**: each user has identity-backed masternode (wallet + RNG seed + public stats). Masternodes form rings/coalitions for verification.
- **Council & Nodes**: elected/appointed nodes (legendary, polymath, art history, bees, pattern-keepers, archangels, etc.) that provide thematic governance and content moderation via on-chain proposals.
- **Shadow realm**: purposely exploitable sandbox environment used to surface zero-day behaviors and train defenses.
- **Cosmic layer**: optional external integration (federated nodes, diplomatic exports, alien-node placeholders for future contact protocols).
- **Data layer**: audited, signed event logs; privacy preserving; replays for forensics (opt-in).
- **Security fabric**: multi-layered (peripheral opt-ins, signed messages, redundancy, white/grey/black hat buckets).

---

## Season + Gameplay primitives
- **Season seeds**: every season chooses a Master Seed (logic, theme, node) that drives world rules and scoring.
- **Autobattler + Mindmon**: main loop is simultaneous action selection. Mindmon mini-game = debate/choice mechanic where players choose value/philosophy cards (rock/paper/scissors elements like Earth/Fire/Water/Metal/Void + Kong/Wuji).
- **Timing system**: baseline time window (example: 5s per decision) with adjustments for non-typers (speech→text, brain→text, assistive input), and bonus multipliers for increased relative speed (not to penalize baseline fastest).
- **Pause / Limbo**:
  - **Personal Pause**: instantaneous, full game-state save; immediate return without loss.
  - **Agreed Pause**: vote or opponent consent pause for synchronized events.
  - **No-Cost Limbo**: limbo is a safe save state, but prolonged use may have cosmetic-only effects — it does *not* break fair play.
  - Accessibility: longer baseline allowed based on user profile; everyone keeps fastest timing but receiving assistance increases rewarded bonuses.
- **Shadow realm**: places for testing, exploits, training red/blue teams — data harvested to auto-patch in a "fix it first" cycle.

---

## Nodes & Roles (selected)
- **Legendary (masternode)**: sentinel mascot, voice of tradition and riddle-giver. Riddle example (for family / justice themes):  
  *“You don’t fear the dark because you are its fiercest thing. Speak what breaks it.”*
- **Polymath**: system integrator node blending science, craft, engineering, and cryptography. Responsible for harmonics, quartz battery research nodes, and algorithmic fairness.
- **Bees (ecology node)**: economic/currency experiments (bee wallets), environmental incentives, honey = universal micro-resource utility.
- **Pattern Keepers**: cryptographers, Sudoku-style puzzle masters, guardians of secrets and the Cicada/translator efforts.
- **Archangel/Angel nodes**: fairness & audit roles (supervisory, not magic — limited powers with logging/auditing).
- **Shadow / Demi-Loki mode**: cosmetic/achievement category for players experimenting with void-like styles without the privileges.

---

## Ethics, privacy, and accessibility
- **Opt-in data** only. Cameras, mic, or ambient sensors must be explicit and reversible.
- **No parental camera for children** unless 18+. Baby soundboard clients work without cameras.
- **Accessibility**: longer base timers, speech-to-text, brain-to-text integration (when available), and alternative objectives such as exercise mini-tasks.
- **No abuse clauses**: hate speech/targeted threats are banned; memes allowed but gated by contextual toxicity filters and community council votes.
- Replace harmful language: where public text used problematic words, replaced with "oddly inspiring."

---

## Security & “fix it first” mechanics
- **Masternode verification**: ID-backed, rotating attestations, human + cryptographic identity link.
- **Shadow realm bounty**: a controlled exploit zone feeding auto-patch pipelines.
- **3-Strike Bee Law**: theft of critical ecological assets (like bee wallets) triggers escalating penalties — replace/restore ×3 rule; heavy Council review for fringe cases (accident, mitigation).
- **Ghost containment**: define degrees of "ghost in the machine" (0.000000000001 residual errors) and put containment & audit clauses in chain policy.
- **Checksum + integrity**: every major proposal & binary release is checksummed and signed.

---

## Cultural / religious / diplomacy nodes
- Soft-coded nodes for prayer times, festival events, and cultural rituals — each requires community/council approval and local experts’ review. Respect & translation layers are required.
- **Council approval** required for using real leaders’ likeness or official religious texts.
- **Language & translator stack**: universal translator node (memetic + linguistic composite) seeded by curated high-quality datasets (Reddit historic answers, vetted scholarship) — gated & audited.

---

## Energy / harmonics / quartz battery concept (polymath)
- **Harmonic Energy node**: research node (speculative) — integrates sound/harmonic energy with crystal resonators (quartz prototypes), geomantic synchronizers (pyramid anchors), and North-Star timing references.
- **Prototype spec (R&D)**: concept doc only. Do not build with real hardware without electrical & safety professionals.
- **Wuji / Kong / Void**: modeling metaphors for adaptive/regressive void effects and how they modify power & timing loops.

---

## Governance, economy & crypto
- **Player wallets** = masternodes. They store identity + reputation + resources.
- **Seasonal tokens** for civic campaigns, political incentives, and post-term legacy channels for politicians (transparent on-chain donations to civic projects).
- **No infinite-upsides**: economic mechanics designed so win = risk; hedge conditions required to protect ecosystem.

---

## Release protocol, Mercy Clause & Nightmare Safeguards
- **Mercy clause / release protocol**: emergency kill-switch gating, council vouches, and mathematical ledger closure ("let math close the ledger").
- **Nightmare safeguard**: final-state protection — refuses to execute irreversible world-level changes without multisig council accept + human oversight.

---

## Appendix A — Glossary (short)
- **Masternode**: user identity + RNG + wallet.
- **Mindmon**: debate/choice battler.
- **Shadow realm**: test & exploit environment.

## Closing notes
This is a living document and intentionally leaves multiple guardrails and Council items to be reviewed by experts (security engineers, ethicists, legal counsel, cultural liaisons, agricultural scientists for bee law, and energy researchers for harmonics). The seed is public domain — build, remix, and improve.
