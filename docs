Purpose: Controlled, regulated partial cellular rejuvenation; never DIY.
Allow: Only inside approved clinical protocols with consent, pause, rollback.
Block: Any unregulated OSKM use; auto-contain & escalate.
Privacy: All runs hashed, consented, and independently auditable.
ε-Ghost: clinical ε = 1e-12; any logic gap => halt + review.
Bee Law: measured externality => 3× restitution via council adjudication.
Intuition Overlay: subtle, reversible cues; never auto-acts; logs rationale hints.
Conclusion Engine: explainable, evidence-based decisions; can act; must justify.
Shadow Flag: “Jumped-to-conclusion” heuristics detected => require human check.
Trigger: unconsented biology, logic gap > 0, or off-policy model behavior.
Actions: Freeze pipeline; preserve state; notify red/blue teams + participant; 
publish incident meta (privacy-preserving); remediation required before resume.
