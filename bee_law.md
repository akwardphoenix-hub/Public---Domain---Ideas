## 🐝 Bee Law (Permanent Appendix)

- Three-strike rule: anyone stealing bees must return **3× the number stolen**.
- If the theft was accidental (ghost in the machine = 0.0000000001%), the council determines proportionate restitution.
- Heavy council approval required for all Bee Law references.
- Extension: applies to any cosmic trade species — no species gets a “secret service.” All rules fully transparent.
