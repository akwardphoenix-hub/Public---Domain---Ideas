BRAVE CODEX
============

A living covenant for those who choose stewardship with courage.

Principles
----------
1. **Courage as Service** – Bravery is used to protect, repair, and restore. Bold action must be balanced by compassion.
2. **Repair First** – When systems fail, responses prioritize restoration and minimization of harm.
3. **Transparency & Accountability** – Actions that affect others are documented and auditable. Trust is earned through clarity.
4. **Proportionality** – Response must fit the scale and intent of the problem.
5. **Restorative Remedies** – Harm is healed by rebuilding and restitution, not punitive spectacle.
6. **Stewardship of Life** – Ecologies, species, and communities are preserved wherever possible; extractive advantage is rejected.
7. **Intuition as Input** – Trained intuition is a signal; it must be validated with evidence before escalatory action.
8. **Council Oversight** – Radical or permanent changes require review by a cross-cultural, multi-disciplinary council.

Practical Rules
---------------
• Three-strike theft rule for essential biosystems (bees, pollination infrastructure): theft requires replacement ×3 plus restoration plan.  
• “Fix it First” protocol: identify, quarantine, restore. No lore above life.  
• Emergency levy (micro-donation system): small, capping, transparent flows for urgent restoration funding.

This codex remains a living document. Amendments must be public, ratified by council, and stamped into the repository history.
