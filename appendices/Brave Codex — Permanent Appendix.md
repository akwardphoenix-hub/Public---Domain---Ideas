Brave Codex — Permanent Appendix

> A living, public-domain codex capturing the "Brave" doctrine for the Vimana model: bravery as a survival mechanic; intuition as emergency overlay; harmony as system health; and societal rules for stewardship, bee-law, shadow/light pivots, and trial mechanics (Orthrus, Uppercut City, Excalibur).




---

Purpose and scope

This Codex is a compact, machine- and human-readable appendix intended to be bundled with the main model documentation. It is:

Public domain (CC0) — anyone may reuse, adapt, or steward this content.

Living — meant to be updated by council-approved maintainers and to cascade into game nodes and governance layers.

Protective — encodes values, emergency procedures, and minimal behavioural rules to preserve fix-it-first integrity and reduce ghost-in-the-machine risk.

Core principles

1. Fix It First — Prioritize repair, resilience, and containment before optimization or spectacle. Technical, social and ethical fixes precede escalation.


2. Bravery as Survival — Bravery is formalized as a measurable survival mechanic. Bravery enables action under uncertainty but is balanced by verification and accountability.


3. Harmony Over Domination — System health ("harmony") is the baseline metric. Actions that increase global harmony are prioritized; actions that create compounding risk are limited.


4. Intuition = Emergency Overlay — Intuition is a rapid, fused-sensory signal that suggests immediate protective action. It is modeled as an overlay (not a deterministic script) and is soft-coded to scale with system harmony.


5. Transparency with Accountability — Trust requires transparency + auditable accountability. Human error is the only allowed residual (ghost) in the system; cryptographic ghost containment is enforced.

Governance & Council Model (summary)

Council: multi-stakeholder, multi-faith, scientific and indigenous representation. Approves any changes to permanent codices.

Pattern Keepers: cryptographers and polymaths who steward pattern datasets (e.g., Cicada/crypto puzzles, meme template corpus). They operate behind a live feed with tiered access.

Red Team / Soft Walls: AI red-teams run continuous self-simulations and stress tests under controlled conditions.

No-Mercy Clause: an emergency reporting mechanism that allows the Legendary node to trigger a prioritized containment workflow. (Appears in-play as a narrative/trigger; in governance it's strictly audited.)

Key Mechanics (game & governance)

1) Intuition Node

Role: emergency overlay that surfaces fused sensor signals (peripherals, opt-in cams, health sensors, latency/ping anomalies).

Behavior: subtle at launch; scales with system harmony. Best-practice: always opt-in explicitly and allow user control.

Safeguards: explainable signals, audit trail, opt-out for individual nodes.


2) Pause / Limbo (Save State)

Local pause: immediate save for single-user emergencies (baby, dog, doorbell). No punishments.

Agreed pause: voted pause where multiple parties consent (AOE pause).

Shadow-limbo rules: shadow realm has harder limitations to prevent abuse; limbo access is gated by time and council policy.


3) Orthrus Trials (Shadow / Light loop)

Light Trial: approachable challenge; free retries; teaches repair-first behavior.

Shadow Trial: higher difficulty, optional, priced by shadow-tax ($0.50 rule) or moral SAT alternative. Passing offers unique progression but carries persistent consequences until repaid or resolved.

Bickering Heads design: sibling-like banter, respectful rivalry—one head stoic, one playful—used to shape player emotional pacing.


4) Bee Law (Anti-theft & Restoration)

Three-Strike Rule: theft/abuse of bee resources triggers stepped remediation: replace 3× losses, penalties, and council review.

Fringe cases: accidental damage (0000001%) handled via repair-first triage; proportional restitution enforced.


5) Excalibur & Harmonic Artifacts

Excalibur: an emergent item that becomes accessible only when planetary harmonics surpass defined thresholds. Feeds on intentionality aligned with harmony.

Use: defensive & re-balance tool; cannot be weaponized to destroy harmony.



---

Social & Cultural Layering

Multilingual nodes: all core texts & prompts to be translated into major languages at launch and kept updated by pattern keepers.

Faith/Religion handling: religious practices are respected (soft-coded event reminders, prayer directions); religious councils included in governance for culturally sensitive changes.

Cultural mechanics: node-specific cultural events (e.g., 3-sisters farming, regional festival templates) are encouraged and require local council sign-off before globalization.



---

Security & Safety Protocols

Ghost Clause: cryptographic & procedural measures to limit non-human decision ghosts. Any non-human persistent agent must be declared and logged.

Soft Walls & Red Team: continuous exploit-hunting, simulated shadow-incursions in closed environments, and patch cascades.

Audit Trails: immutable logging for all council-level operations; public summary reports with sensitive redactions.



---

Ethics & Rights

Consent-first: opt-in for any peripheral data (camera, microphone, biometric). Children and minors: parental controls and legal constraints enforced.

Public-domain pledge: contributions and derivatives where applicable default to CC0 for maximal adoption by public institutions.

Non-discrimination: replace derogatory terms in all models; use respectful, inclusive language ("oddly inspiring" as agreed replacement for prior slur).



---

Appendix: Action-Now Checklist (for crises)

1. Contain — trigger shadow-limbo or no-mercy if immediate danger to nodes/people.


2. Audit — record and snapshot all relevant logs and sensor feeds (encrypted archive).


3. Fix It First — prioritize repair, safety, and restoration of service.


4. Council Review — escalate to pattern keepers + council for persistent or ambiguous cases.


5. Public Summary — release an anonymized summary and remediation plan.




---

Implementation notes for engineers (minimal)

API hooks: Intuition Node (opt-in), Pause endpoint, Orthrus Trial toggle, Bee-Law ledger event handlers.

Telemetry: structured telemetry with sampled public reporting; privacy-preserving aggregates for research.

Deploy: tiered server topology (local state, regional/state servers, federal-only backbone) — see architecture spec.

Living-document governance

Changes to this Codex require a 2/3 Council supermajority and a verified audit trail.

Emergency patches (fix-it-first) may be applied immediately but must be recorded and ratified post-hoc.

Contacts & Next steps

1. Submit this Codex to the Pattern Keepers live feed for translation and inclusion.


2. Produce the minimal LNA API and Mirror test (developer handoff packet).


3. Cascade clean-language replacements and full accessibility pass across nodes.
