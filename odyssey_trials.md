## 🐺 Orthrus Trials

- Guardian of the first gate in Shadow/Lite Odyssey.
- Two heads:
  - **Alpha Head**: strict, annoyed, tests resolve.
  - **Puppy Head**: playful, empathetic, sometimes breaks character.
- Light Realm: trial allows retries, no cost, Obi-Wan style “are you sure?”
- Shadow Realm: failure = harsher penalty; must pay 50¢ shadow tax OR pass morality SAT pop-quiz to return.
- Respectful twin-style bickering, not chaotic clipping.
