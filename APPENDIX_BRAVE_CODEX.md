Brave Codex — Permanent Appendix (draft)

Below is a compact, ready-to-use Brave Codex to be appended to the project documentation and cascaded into the game / masternode model.
It’s written so it can be copy-pasted into your repo as a single appendix file (e.g., APPENDIX_BRAVE_CODEX.md) and also used as a spec for engineers, designers, and council review. I included both the human-readable rules and practical integration steps for cascading into all relevant nodes.

Purpose

The Brave Codex encodes the ethical, mechanical, and civic rules for bravery as a gameplay & civic metric across the model: how bravery is measured, rewarded, corrected, and governed. It exists to preserve the spirit: bravery is a survival mechanic, tempered by empathy, intuition, and repair — “we heal ourselves until we get home safely.”


---

Quick summary (one-line)

Bravery is a measurable, contextual game-state and civic attribute that unlocks access, responsibilities, and obligations; it is tracked, auditable, revocable, and bound to councils and harmonics.


---

Core principles

1. Fix It First — prevention & repair outrank spectacle. Brave acts must align with restorative aims.


2. Intuition then Choice — players get an intuition overlay; action remains their choice. Intuition is an emergency overlay, not a trap.


3. Proportionate Courage — bravery without recklessness is rewarded; foolhardy harm is penalized.


4. Transparency with Guardrails — brave actions and their audits are transparent to council/verification systems, but personal safety and privacy are respected.


5. No Mercy Clause (contextual) — reserved, governed authority for urgent protection; must include logs, council review, and an appeal path.


6. Inclusivity — bravery recognizes cultural forms (rituals, chants, work) and supports alternative inputs (singing, sign language, motion).

Definitions (key terms)

BraveryScore: numeric + categorical metric representing a player’s bravery state. Includes sub-metrics: Intent, Effect, RepairIndex, HarmDelta.

Intuition Overlay: translucent emergency UI prompt derived from multisensor inputs and past-behavior model.

Trial (Ortrhus Trial, Odyssey Event): optional PvE/PvP challenge that evaluates bravery, repair behavior, and moral intelligence.

No Mercy Clause: approved emergency authority that can initiate immediate protective actions; always logged and reviewed.

Pattern Keepers: cryptographers/polymaths responsible for verifying high-impact bravery actions and feeding council.

Bee Law: species & resource protection laws (three-strike restorative enforcement for ecological theft).



---

BraveScore formula (high level)

BraveScore = f(Intent, RiskFactor, PositiveOutcome, RepairIndex, CouncilEndorsement)

Intent (−1..+1): inferred intent from actions & contextual data.

RiskFactor (0..1): physical/mental risk taken.

PositiveOutcome (−1..+2): measurable public/private repair or protection.

RepairIndex (0..1): how much follow-up repair occurred.

CouncilEndorsement (0/1/2): retroactive validation by council or community vote.


(Implementation note: concrete normalization constants live in game config; adjust via governance votes.)


---

Bravery mechanics (gameplay)

1. Acquisition: Brave actions (rescuing, shielding, sacrificial repair, whistleblowing with evidence) trigger BraveScore updates.


2. Voting & Validation: High-impact bravery requires community/council validation (automatic voting window or designated Pattern Keeper review).


3. Trial outcomes: Success => rewards (cosmetic, access, reputation tokens); Failure => loss of small BraveScore, remediation tasks.


4. Shadow/Light Realms: Shadow realm tests grant higher BraveScore potential but carry heavier RepairIndex obligations.


5. $0.50 Rule (temporary shadow-to-light pass mechanic): players may pay a small civic fee OR pass a morality/puzzle checkpoint to return — can be replaced by earned exemptions via quizzes / service. (Configurable.)


6. Three-strike alternatives: For ecological crimes (bee theft etc.), three strikes => restorative obligations + council hearing; repeated harm escalates enforcement.




---

Rights & Responsibilities

Rights: to access emergency intuition overlays; to request council appeal; to receive transparent logs of any No Mercy action.

Responsibilities: to pay remediation costs (if liable); to participate in community audits when requested; to avoid exploitative “bravery performative” acts that harm others.



---

Enforcement & appeals

1. Automated detection flags potential abuse; Pattern Keepers triage.


2. Council review for escalations (No Mercy usage, major ecological harm).


3. Appeal window opens automatically after enforcement; appeals are adjudicated by an independent council node.


4. Ghost Containment: a small, auditable “ghost in the machine” allowance of human error; anything beyond that triggers escalation.




---

Cultural and accessibility hooks

Alternate bravery inputs: singing (mic input), sign-language trigger, movement (gyroscope), time-of-day ritual (local harmonic syncing).

Replace language that hurts: use respectful phrasing (e.g., “oddly inspiring” or “outlier behavior”) — cascade sanitization script included below.



---

Example canonical entries (to paste into character sheets / nodes)

Legendary Oath (short):

> “I stand in the dark and bring the light. I act for repair, not for ruin. I will heal myself until we get home safely.”



Ortrhus Trial summary (entry):

> Two-headed guardian tests humility & courage. Passing requires protecting the ferryman projection or paying restored service; bickering heads offer hints.

Implementation: cascade steps (engineer checklist)

1. Create file APPENDIX_BRAVE_CODEX.md in repo root (copy this whole doc).


2. Metadata tag: add header front-matter for search:



title: Brave Codex
tags: [appendix, code-of-conduct, bravery, game-mechanics]
visibility: permanent
cascade: true

3. Search & replace: run sanitization to replace offensive legacy terms with approved alternatives (script example below).


4. Integrate BraveScore: add BraveScore schema to player_state proto/DB; add BraveScore update hooks to event handlers (rescue, whistleblower, trial_complete).


5. Intuition overlay: add UI/UX module intuition_overlay that is toggleable and returns telemetry to Pattern Keepers.


6. Ortrhus/Trial nodes: include trial metadata in events/odyssey folder and wire rewards/penalties.


7. Council queues: add high-impact bravery events to council_queue with automatic voting window and Pattern Keeper priorities.


8. No Mercy audit log: implement no_mercy_log (immutable append-only with cryptographic sigs) and automatic council review job.


9. Bee law binding: map three-strike rule to ecological resource IDs and add automatic remediation tasks generator.


10. Testing: unit tests for BraveScore math; integration tests for trial outcomes; red-team exploit simulation.


11. Localization: translate Brave Codex into target languages and cascade into multilingual nodes.


12. Deployment: stage to beta servers with shadow realm toggles; gather UX feedback before full cascade.



Script snippet (example) to sanitize legacy language:

# run from repo root (POSIX)
grep -Rl "retard" | xargs sed -i 's/retard/oddly inspiring/g'
# run linter and manual review afterwards

Governance & versioning

Brave Codex is a living appendix: edits require council proposal + 2/3 approval for “permanent” changes.

Minor technical tweaks (normalization constants, UI copy) can be hot-fixed via dev ops with audit trail.



---

Emergency provisions

Ghost Clause: accidental errors under threshold .000000001 are human error; above threshold triggers Pattern Keeper audit.

No Mercy Use: immediate protective action allowed only when: imminent harm detected, logs captured, council ticket auto-created in 10s. Appeals allowed after 24–72 hrs.



---

Quick-launch checklist for the handoff packet

1. Add APPENDIX_BRAVE_CODEX.md to repo root.


2. Configure BraveScore schema (DB migration).


3. Deploy intuition_overlay as opt-in on client.


4. Add no_mercy_log and council_queue background workers.


5. Run sanitization pass (language).


6. Put Pattern Keeper role in access control list (ACL).


7. Run red-team and user-acceptance tests (UAT).


8. Publish to staging and open council review.

Sample commit message for cascade

feat(codecs): Add APPENDIX_BRAVE_CODEX.md; integrate BraveScore schema; add NoMercy logging hooks; sanitize legacy terms; add council_queue job. See docs/APPENDIX_BRAVE_CODEX.md


---

Short Legendary-style riddle (for flavor, optional UI)

> “Face the dark, and you will find your shadow is only your other hand. Cut through fear with care — leave the wound to heal.”



(Placeable in Legendary codex entry; optional.)

Final notes & next steps (for you)

If you want I can:

1. Produce the APPENDIX_BRAVE_CODEX.md file content in full (formatted), ready to drop in your repo.


2. Produce the BraveScore JSON/Proto schema and a small test harness for BraveScore updates.


3. Output localization stubs for major languages (EN/ES/FR/AR/HI/ZH/JP).




Tell me which of those you want me to output right now and I’ll generate it ready-to-paste. If not, you can paste this appendix text into your repo immediately and follow the cascade checklist.
