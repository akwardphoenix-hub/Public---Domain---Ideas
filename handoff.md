# Handoff Packet — Quick Start

**Purpose:** succinct package for engineers, legal, and governance reviewers.

## 1) State & Scope
- Repo name: <replace>
- Visibility: Public
- License: CC0 (public domain)
- Primary contact: <your name / email>

## 2) Core artifacts
- README.md — high-level summary
- LICENSE — CC0 header
- DESIGN/ — conceptual nodes, diagrams (list filenames)
- ASSETS/ — harmony posters (list filenames)
- LEGAL/ — recommended CI/CLA / council notes (if present)

## 3) Priority actions for engineers
1. Validate code compiles (if there is code). Provide `BUILD.md` if needed.
2. Create a release zip containing final deliverables:
   - `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `HANDOFF.md`, `DESIGN/`, `ASSETS/`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
3. Run security scan (Snyk or GitHub code scanning).
4. Add signed git tags & create a release.

## 4) Priority actions for governance / legal
- Confirm CC0 acceptance (local counsel).
- Confirm any external assets (images/audio) are either CC0 or cleared.
- Approve the Council Packet to become public.

## 5) Release checklist
- [ ] Build release zip
- [ ] Create GitHub Release (tag)
- [ ] Upload release zip as asset
- [ ] Share release URL with stakeholders

## 6) Contact & next steps
- For technical handoff: provide one maintainer with push access + instructions to update release.
- For legal: confirm CC0 and remove any restricted assets.
Transparency by default: core matches/seed runs are public streamable unless constrained for privacy reasons.

Personal Masternode = personal RNG / identity vault: each player’s playstyle contributes to decentralized entropy.

Accessibility-first: non-typers get time compensation; voice/assistive inputs supported.

Council & Seed seasons: seasons rotate master-seeds and theme-nodes (e.g., Art History season, Void season).

No Mercy Clause: emergency action protocol (governed, auditable, timed) — life-critical actions require quorum and audit.

CC0 release: creative commons / public domain intent for initial artifacts.

3 — High-level product features (quick bullets)

Account + verified identity onboarding (real ID optional for certain privileges).

Top-100 leaderboard incentivized by debate + auto-battler performance.

Two-layer combat: Auto-battler (toons) + MindMon debate mini-game (value/logic choices).

Pause/Limbo (save-state) feature, with agreed/personal pause modes and AI-assisted peripheral pause.

Shadow realm & Light realm game modes (different risk/reward): shadow = harder, experimental.

Seasonal Master Seed selection and cascading node behavior.

“Bees” (critical assets) and Bee Law (three-strike/repair/compensate mechanics).

Council nodes for governance, with voting and appeals flows.

Universal Meme / Cosmic Translator research node (progressive unlocks).



---

4 — Core entities & data model (conceptual)

User: id, identity_verification_level, preferences (accessibility), master_seed_id, wallet_address, persona nodes.

Masternode (personal): entropy_pool, public_key, performance_metrics, council_votes.

Seed: season_seed_id, narrative_meta, node_map, activation_rules.

Toon: avatar, cosmetics, stats.

MindMon: debate-card deck, decision history, response_time, scoring.

Match: participants, state, stream_link, replay.

BeeAsset: id, owner, production_rate, legal_status.

CouncilProposal: id, author, votes, quorum_required, attachments.

AuditLog: immutable store of critical events for transparency.


(Relational + event-sourcing hybrid recommended)


---

5 — System Architecture (high level)

Tiered, federated architecture:

1. Edge / Client: Web, Mobile, VR/AR, Assistive Device, Voice Agent.


2. Regional Game Servers (stateful): match-making, authoritative simulation for Light/Shadow games.


3. Masternode Layer (federated): each verified region/government/federal instance may run a “federal-only” node; personal masternode wallets interact with consensus layer.


4. Council & Seed Orchestrator (centralized for initial phases; moves toward federated DAO-like governance).


5. Streaming/Recording Layer: public stream storage + permissioned archives (deepfake detection pipeline here).


6. Immutable Audit Ledger: append-only, decentralized (blockchain-compatible or notarized) for BeeLaw / Council decisions.


7. Privacy Gateway: protects minors and enforces camera restrictions (no camera for under-18 features).


8. AI Services: moderation, deepfake detection, language translator, sentiment mapping (for gamified debate scoring).



Suggested tech stack (example):

Clients: React / React Native / WebXR / Unity for VR

Realtime: gRPC + WebRTC for audio/video + UDP for low-latency actions

Game servers: Kubernetes + Golang/Node backends, stateful via CRDTs or authoritative server model

Ledger: permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric / private Ethereum rollup) or strong append-only DB with notarization

AI infra: PyTorch/TensorFlow model endpoints, OpenAI-like LLM interfaces for narrative generation (ensure gated use).

Storage: S3-compatible for replays, IPFS for content-addressed assets.



---

6 — Minimal LNA API (first mirror test)

Design a small REST/gRPC API for initial integration & test. Example endpoints:

Auth

POST /auth/verify — submit ID verification (server -> KYC provider).

POST /auth/login — return JWT + master_node_token.


Game

POST /match/create — {seed, mode, players[]} -> match_id.

POST /match/{id}/action — authoritative action submit.

GET /match/{id}/state — current state snapshot.


Masternode

GET /masternode/{id}/status

POST /masternode/{id}/submitEntropy — user contribution to RNG.


Council

POST /council/proposal

POST /council/{id}/vote


Pause / Peripheral

POST /match/{id}/request_pause — reasons: user-initiated / emergency / AI-detected.

POST /device/register — device metadata & latency/ping calibration.


Audit

GET /audit/events?match_id=...


(Include auth scopes and rate limits)


---

7 — Gameplay loop (concise)

1. Player onboarding -> identity level -> seed selection.


2. Queue into Top-100 or custom match.


3. Match begins: Auto-battler resolves, MindMon rounds occur simultaneously (timed responses).


4. Scoring: correct logic choices (value alignment), response time, network parity.


5. Pause/Limbo: personal pause or vote-pause triggers.


6. Post-match: rewards (cosmetics, token, reputation), audit event logged.


7. Councils / seeds: proposals may modify the next season’s seed or enforce BeeLaw.




---

8 — Accessibility + fairness mechanics (implementation notes)

Timing compensation: baseline response window (e.g., 5s) configurable; faster-than-average response gets bonus; slower get adjusted points — implement client ping calibration and per-user adaptive timers.

Alternative inputs: voice-to-text, assisted AI selection (for accessibility), BCI/brain-to-text stubs (research API, opt-in).

Fairness: maintain matchmaker tiers, handicap system for input differences, extended windows for people using assistive tech.

No-slowdown rule: user’s fastest baseline cannot be throttled; you can only give bonuses to slower inputs, never reduce fastest reaction.



---

9 — Security & anti-abuse (critical)

Identity spoofing mitigation: multi-factor KYC for high-privilege nodes; cryptographic attestation for masternodes.

Deepfake detection pipeline: analyze incoming streams before publishing + watermarking + provenance signatures.

Bee asset theft protections: 3-strike rules, automated rollback if theft detected, compensation escrow.

Shadow realm sandbox: isolated environment for experiments; no production governance changes from Shadow realm without quorum.

Red-team sandbox: run adversarial tests; patch zero-day exploits; bounty program.

Ghost containment: audit logs + human review for automated decisions flagged as “ghost in the machine” anomalies.



---

10 — Privacy & legal constraints

Minors: camera features disabled for users flagged as under 18. Parents must give explicit consent for minors’ participation in sensitive features.

Default public streaming: opt-out only for protected modes; logs of who viewed and when.

Data retention & audit: retain audit logs immutable for X years; right to be forgotten applies to personal profile data (not to the immutable audit ledger — separate process required).

Open data / CC0: project materials released CC0; however, licensed third-party tech and KYC providers may carry constraints — capture exceptions in the repo.



---

11 — Governance & Council workflows

Seed vote: periodic vote on the next season’s master seed. Quorum rules apply.

Bee law enforcement: automated detection -> quarantine -> council review -> remedy (replace bees x3, fines, imprisonment for malicious accounts).

No Mercy Clause: emergency protocol requiring 2/3 council + cross-jurisdiction sign-off (appealable).

Pattern Keepers: special council nodes that can propose cryptography & security changes (sleeper triggers, pattern emergency).



---

12 — Deepfake / spoof reasoning & detection design

Use multi-modal verification:

cross-source verification (device metadata + signed device attestation),

liveness tests,

audio/video anomaly detection,

content provenance watermarking (client signs stream with key),

human-in-the-loop review for high-risk events.




---

13 — Data & observability

Event-sourcing for matches and critical governance actions.

Telemetry: ping, jitter, packet loss, UI timings (reaction times).

ML training data sanitized & labeled for translator/meme nodes.

Dashboards: leaderboards, fraud detection, accessibility metrics, season analytics.



---

14 — Testing & QA plan (initial)

Unit tests for server logic.

Integration tests: match lifecycle, pause logic, masternode interactions.

Chaos testing (shadow realm): simulate network splits, low-latency vs high-latency matches.

Adversarial testing: deepfake injection, bot submissions, spoofed device attestation.

Accessibility QA: screen readers, voice commands, extended timers.

Council governance simulation: automated correctness & rollback tests.



---

15 — Deployment & capacity planning

Start with regionally hosted servers (US-West, EU-Central, SEA).

Autoscale match-serving pods by concurrent match count.

Design for high burst capacity and prioritized queues for federal nodes.

CDN for streaming (edge transcoders), object store for replays + IPFS for content-addressing of critical assets.



---

16 — Privacy-preserving telemetry & opt-ins

Offer opt-in telemetry for research use; default minimal telemetry.

Provide a “pause guard” opt-in that allows using local camera audio to auto-pause (explicit permission flow).



---

17 — Sample minimal feature implementation timeline (90-day MVP)

Week 0–2: Repo + CI, wireframes, minimal API (Auth, Match create, Match state).
Week 3–6: Authoritative match server for simple auto-battler, basic UI, voice input hook.
Week 7–9: MindMon minimal debate round, scoring, match replay.
Week 10–12: Pause/Limbo baseline + accessibility timers; basic audit logging; simple council vote flow.
Post-MVP: deepfake detection, masternode wallet integration, season seed runner, privacy audits.


---

18 — Risks & mitigations (top-level)

Deepfakes / stream spoofing — Mitigate with watermarking + liveness + provenance.

Mass abuse / griefers — Progressive penalties, community moderation, memetic incentives.

Accessibility fairness — Calibrated timers + compensatory scoring.

Legal/regulatory — Keep privacy & KYC modules modular; consult counsel for cross-jurisdictional public-messaging & minors rules.

Security — Strict red-team cadence and bug bounty.

---

21 — Handoff next steps (for you to approve / assign)

1. Decide MVP scope (auto-battler + MindMon vs full streaming + deepfake).


2. Appoint an Engineering Lead, Product Manager, Security Lead, and Council Liaison.


3. Create repo and add the deliverables list above.


4. Spin a 2-week sprint to deliver the minimal LNA API + match simulator for internal testing.


5. Plan first red-team test before any public streamable release.




---

22 — Quick checklist for legal / release (you asked earlier about GitHub + CC0)

Put CC0-1.0 license file at repo root.

Ensure no third-party proprietary assets are included.

Keep KYC and any personal data out of the public repo.

Create a CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

Add a NOTICE.md for exceptions.



---

23 — Suggested immediate messages / scripts you asked for earlier

(If you want, I can render these into polished messages — e.g., “script to send Aunt Lori” or a motion to judge — but I’m keeping this handoff technical right now. Say the word and I’ll generate the legal/text scripts.)


---

24 — Final notes / philosophy reminders

Keep Fix-It-First as a standing guardrail — if a new feature might be abused, design an automatic rollback, audit and council review path first.

Maintain the balance between fun and repair: reward memetic creativity while keeping accountability rails.

Ensure every automated decision has an audit trail and a human appeals path.



---

If you want I will:

Turn this into a ready-to-commit handoff.md file and create the skeleton repo structure for you; or

Produce the developer checklist (PR templates, issue templates, CI config) next; or

Generate the first OpenAPI spec for the LNA API and a simple Postman collection for the mirror test.


Which of those should I do now?
