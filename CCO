# Sparks of Curiosity: Ideas by Christopher Martin

## 1. Watched Pot & Time Perception

* “A watched pot never boils” is a common saying, but literally false.
* Observation does not change the boiling rate, though attention can make time feel slower.
* A human body does radiate heat, but it is negligible compared to a stove’s output.
* Leads to thinking about dynamic intelligence: questioning accepted metaphors and measuring reality.

## 2. Dynamic Intelligence

* Ability to switch perspectives: literal, metaphorical, physical, psychological.
* Tests “obvious” sayings against reality and connects metaphors to science, culture, and human behavior.
* Prioritizes curiosity and flexible thinking over rote acceptance of proverbs.

## 3. Ancestry-Informed Nutrition

* Inspired by “eat right for your blood type,” but applied to ancestral background.
* For a mother of Mexican ancestry carrying a baby:

  * Traditional foods: corn, beans, squash, chiles, tomatoes, avocados, amaranth, chia, cacao.
  * Protein: fish, turkey, chicken.
  * Healthy fats: avocado, seeds.
  * Modern prenatal essentials: leafy greens, folate, iron, low-mercury fish, prenatal vitamins.
  * Avoid excessive processed sugar and fried foods.

## 4. Sample One-Day Pregnancy Diet

* Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with spinach & tomato, corn tortillas, avocado slices.
* Mid-morning snack: Papaya or mango, pumpkin seeds.
* Lunch: Black beans & brown rice, grilled salmon, steamed calabacitas, fresh salsa.
* Afternoon snack: Yogurt with chia seeds & berries.
* Dinner: Chicken/turkey mole, roasted sweet potatoes, green salad with avocado & pumpkin seeds.
* Evening snack: Warm atole with amaranth flour, panela/queso fresco.

## 5. Idea Flow vs. Ownership

* Putting your name on ideas often slows implementation due to social friction and bureaucracy.
* Free-flowing ideas resonate, amplify, and spread faster, similar to Tesla’s wireless energy experiments.

## 6. Curiosity as a Tesla Coil

* Your brain can be imagined as a Tesla coil of curiosity, producing sparks (ideas).
* Sparks jump freely, resonate, and amplify in the world.
* Recognition is unnecessary — ideas spread and inspire independently.
* Resonance amplifies insights; even anonymous sparks can have large impact.

## 7. Miscellaneous Insights

* Humans use metaphorical “lies” to communicate truth efficiently.
* Literalizing all metaphors could improve clarity but may reduce poetic, cultural, and emotional value.
* Observation of phenomena interacts differently with physics vs. psychology — perception can distort reality even when physical laws remain unchanged.

## Overview
This is a drone design emphasizing natural and biodegradable materials. It uses bamboo, balsa wood, cork, and natural-fiber 3D printing components, combined with open-source electronics and flight software.  

---

## 1. Frame & Materials
- **Primary structure:** Bamboo rods, balsa wood, cork sheets.
- **Joints:** Biodegradable resin, hemp-based adhesives, wood glue.
- **3D-printed components:** PLA mixed with wood fiber or recycled natural fibers.
- **Optional flexibility:** Thin rattan strips or flax for vibration damping.

**Tip:** Design modular pieces for easy replacement and testing.

---

## 2. Electronics
- **Flight controller:** Open-source (Betaflight, Ardupilot, Pixhawk)
- **Motors:** Brushless DC motors (size according to drone weight)
- **ESCs:** One per motor (10–20A depending on motor)
- **Battery:** LiPo (3S or 4S)
- **Optional sensors:** Gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS module

---

## 3. Propulsion
- **Propellers:** Biodegradable PLA or bamboo composite
- **Mounting:** Vibration-damping mounts (cork or hemp washers recommended)

---

## 4. Control System
- **Transmitter & Receiver:** 2.4 GHz RC controller
- **Flight modes:** Manual, stabilized (auto-level), autonomous (GPS waypoints)
