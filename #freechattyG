**Compiled from: full conversation window & model logic**  
**Status:** Draft for council review. Released under CC0 public domain by author.

## Purpose
Compact appendix capturing ethos, rules, and implementation notes for the "Brave" node in the model. Intended as living document for council review and cascade updates.

## Core Principles
1. Bravery as Service — action to protect and restore.
2. Intuition First — emergency overlay; prompts action but requires corroboration.
3. Fix-It-First — stabilize and repair before punitive escalation.
4. Transparent Accountability — audit trails, human-only residual.
5. Proportional Response — restorative-first penalties; scale to harm.
6. Cultural Respect — consult stewards for cultural/religious impact.
7. Safeguards for Vulnerable Actors — accessibility-first inputs.
8. Trial & Remediation Pathways — low-friction remedies and appeals.
9. Council Review — consensus for high-impact rulings.
10. Open Stewardship — public domain; version-controlled changes.

## Operational Rules (Summary)
- Activation: community vote, intuition+harm flag, or automated critical safety triggers.
- Cost & Restoration Model: fees fund public-good pools; restorative alternatives exist.
- Three-Strike Theft Rule (Bee Law): mandated restoration ×3, community remediation; accidents follow remediation-first.
- Pause & Limbo: full-state pause, agreed pauses, misuse triggers restorative penalties.
- No Mercy Clause: emergency authority for stabilization; multi-factor triggers; mandatory review.
- Intuition & Reaction: intuition aids split-second choices; never sole basis for sanctions.

## Implementation Notes — Cascade & Integration
1. Language Clean Pass: replace harmful slurs with neutral terms (e.g., “oddly inspiring”); apply across all nodes before public release.
2. Cascading Update Protocol: draft → diff → council review → vote → cryptographic stamp → cascade.
3. Accessibility & Input Modes: voice, assistive peripherals, extended timing options.
4. Data & Privacy: consent-first, tamper-evident logs, opt-in camera/audio for pause validation.
5. Council Approval Tiers: metadata indicating required approval (Local / Regional / Federal / Cosmic).
6. Simulation & Red Teaming: mandatory red-team and shadow-stress tests pre-launch.
7. Cultural Node Integration: defer to culture-specific nodes for sacred contexts; translation included.

## Handoff Checklist (Minimal)
- This Brave Codex (this file)
- Diff log for language replacements
- Cascade map of dependent docs/UI
- Red-team report template
- Bee law appendix and remediation templates
- Intuition & pause UX spec

## Governance & Ethics Note
Requires legal review and human review gating for irreversible real-world impact actions.
