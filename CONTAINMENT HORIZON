GHOST_EPSILON (ε): the entire allowed uncertainty budget for a system.
Norm: Trust score T = 1 − ε, where 0 < ε << 1 and ε is *human-factors only*
(not logic gaps). Logic paths must be fully specified or blocked.

Defaults:
- Gameplay & non-safety UX: ε = 1e-9  →  T = 0.999999999
- Life-sciences / clinical / biosafety nodes: ε = 1e-12 → T = 0.999999999999
- Disclosure: ε must be declared, logged, and independently audited.
- Any observed logic-gap > 0 triggers No-Mercy Containment until fixed.
